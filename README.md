- Persistent settings and draft recovery

## v3 Changes
- Modular TypeScript source in `src/` with compiled output in `dist/`

- Local-first loading for Pyodide + CodeMirror (no CDN required)

## v2 Changes

- Improved editor and console readability
- Status bar with execution state and cursor info

## Local assets
- External JS/CSS/fonts are vendored under `assets/` for offline/local use.
- Pyodide files live in `assets/vendor/pyodide/` and are loaded locally.

## Development
Build the TypeScript into `dist/`:
```sh
npm exec --yes --package typescript@5.4.5 tsc -- --project tsconfig.json
```

Serve locally (Pyodide requires HTTP, not `file://`):
```sh
python3 -m http.server
```
